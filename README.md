### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United - Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

### Files used
The related CSV files for the cities are not tracked in this repo but they are available upon request.

### Credits
The content of the README file was written based on the project overview in the Udacity course: Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program.
